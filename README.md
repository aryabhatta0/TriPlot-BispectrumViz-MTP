**TriPlot** is an interactive Python-based visualization framework for analyzing the bispectrum in redshift space, with particular emphasis on primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) and redshift space distortions (RSD). This tool was developed as part of a Master's thesis project at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.

## üî¨ Scientific Background

The bispectrum is the Fourier transform of the three-point correlation function and serves as a crucial probe of non-Gaussian features in the cosmic matter distribution. Unlike the power spectrum, the bispectrum is sensitive to phase correlations and can distinguish between different inflationary scenarios through primordial non-Gaussianity signatures.

This framework addresses the complex interplay between:
- **Primordial Non-Gaussianity**: Subtle deviations from Gaussian initial conditions that encode information about early universe physics
- **Redshift Space Distortions**: Anisotropic effects introduced by galaxy peculiar velocities along the line of sight
- **Triangle Configurations**: The geometric dependence of the bispectrum on wavevector triangle shapes and orientations

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Interactive Visualization Tools
- **Real-time triangle rendering** from parameterized configurations in (Œº, t) space
- **Normalized bispectrum heatmaps** across physically allowed triangle domains
- **Orientation-dependent analysis** showing redshift space anisotropies
- **Multi-template support** for different PNG types (local, equilateral, orthogonal)
